### notes on processing schedule

For info, the maps are generated on 2 schedules. Views that hold more than 250,000 occurrences are built daily, and views that hold less are built every 2hrs on normal operation.
There are approximately 3000-4000 views with >250,000 such as Animalia, Aves, Taiwan, US, eBird etc and the rest such as typical datasets and most taxa holding less. This is why dataset maps normally appear quite quickly. You can see on each map in GBIF.org when it was last prepared (time reflects when we snapshot the data).
